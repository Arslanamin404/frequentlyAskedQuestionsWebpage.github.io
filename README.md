THIS IS A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS WEBPAGE DESIGNED BY ME.MOHAMMAD ARSALAN RATHER.
I CREATED THIS WEBPAGE USING HTML CSS AND BISICIS OF JAVASCRIPT.
IN Javascript I used addEventListener, for loop, this keyword, classList.togle('active') to create this accordion.
in css we used display none and display block property to show and hide text content.
